Thresholds are meant to answer queries like \"what is the first time point where the number of COVID cases will cross 10% of the population?\", or \"when will the ball reach the wall?\". Intervention is then an assessment of policies around such thresholds. For example, \"when should we start and stop an enforced masking policy to keep the total number of COVID cases below 10% for the full time period?\". Thus these two analyses go hand in hand: threshold queries give us information about when thresholds will be reached, while intervention functions give us optimal strategies for avoiding such thresholds.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/threshold_interventions/","page":"Designing Threshold Interventions","title":"Designing Threshold Interventions","text":"To see this in action, let's create a model of the population of rabbits in a post-apocolyptic Earth where fauna and humans have moved to Mars on SpaceX ships, but a few bunnies were accidentally left behind to use Earth as an approximately infinite food source.

Let's say a corporation has created a \"Earth viewing tourism\" business where humans are watch the bunny population through a telescope. Market research has found that when there are more than 3bB in the population, the reaction goes from \"that's cute\" to \"eww too many rodants\", and thus to maximize their profits the corporation wants to fire a laser that indescrimitely kills bunnies at an exponential rate (which just happens to be the same rate as twice the growth of the bunny population). But as you probably know from experience, operating death rays that cover the distance from Mars to Earth cost a lot to operate, so the corporation wants to run this for as short as possible.

By choosing 27.8 months as the off point, this will allow for the rest of the time to be tourism friendly.
