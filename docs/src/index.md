# EasyModelAnalysis.jl

EasyModelAnalysis does exactly what it says: it makes model analysis easy. Want to know the first time
the number of infected individuals is about 1000? What is the probability that more than 50 people will
be infected given probability distributions for the parameters? What variables are the most sensitive?
Please find the parameters that best fit the model to the data. All of these, and more, given as simple
one-liner queries over [ModelingToolkit](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/)-defined
differential equation models.

## Installation

To install EasyModelAnalysis.jl, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("EasyModelAnalysis")
```
